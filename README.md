# RepByZone

As you wander around Azeroth, your reputation bar will switch depending on where you are, not by which quest gave you a faction bump.

## Supports

- Gained Retail WoW support! Completed January 26, 2022, at least until patch 9.2 releases. If I missed any scenarios or other areas, let me know.
- Zones by faction: Stormwind, Darkspear Trolls, Gnomeregan Exiles, Orgrimmar, etc.
- Instances by faction: Hydraxian Waterlords, Brood of Nozdormu, etc
- Battlegrounds by faction: Silverpike Guard, Warsong Outriders, etc
- Subzones by faction: several little areas in various zones have pockets of faction hubs
- WoD Bodyguards' reputations can be watched instead of zone reputations
- Wrath and retail support equipped capital city tabards while in dungeons
- Toggle on/off switching watched factions while you are taking taxi flights
- If you haven't discovered a zone reputation or there isn't one, select a default fallback watched reputation
- Some races have an associated reputation, which you can use instead of the default fallback reputation

## Open the options

- `/rbz`
- `/repbyzone`
- `ESC, Interface, AddOns, RepByZone`

## Translate

RepByZone can be localized using Curseforge's [online localization](https://legacy.curseforge.com/wow/addons/repbyzone/localization) URL.

## Known Issues

- It is not possible to display zone or subzone data for reputations the character has not yet discovered. Once a character gains or loses any amount of reputation with that faction and moves around the zone, RBZ will update.
- Discovering the faction may require the character to explore other zones or even continents, then kill mobs or do quests for the faction.
