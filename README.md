As you wander around Azeroth, your reputation bar will switch depending on where you are, not by which quest gave you a faction bump.

Open the options:

    /repbyzone
    ESC, Interface, AddOns, RepByZone

Translate:

RepByZone has its own translations and LibAboutPanel-2.0's localizations.
Known Issues:

    In some rare cases, characters have not learned their racial or class reputation because they have not interacted with an NPC from that faction. This causes the Default Watched Reputation menu to have nothing selected. For example, my Rogue has never interacted with Ravenholdt. I could go down the rabbit hole and provide workarounds, but upon testing, this proved to be a bad idea. Please check this menu when you first log into a character, and if required, select a Default Watched Reputation if you wish. Not selecting one will do no harm, and once your character learns the reputation, RepByZone will fix itself.
    It is not possible to display zone or subzone data for reputations the character has not yet discovered. Examples would be Gurubashi Arena and Bloodsail Buccaneers faction, or Arathi Highlands and Wildhammer Clan faction. Once a character gains or loses any amount of reputation with that faction and moves around the zone, RBZ will update. Discovering the faction may require the character to explore other zones or even continents.
