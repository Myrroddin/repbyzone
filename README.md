# RepByZone

As you wander around Azeroth, your reputation bar will switch depending on where you are, not by which quest gave you a faction bump.

## Supports

- Zones by faction: Stormwind, Darkspear Trolls, Gnomeregan Exiles, Orgrimmar, etc.
- Instances by faction: Hydraxian Waterlords, Brood of Nozdormu, etc
- Battlegrounds by faction: Silverpike Guard, Warsong Outriders, etc
- Subzones by faction: several little areas in various zones have pockets of faction hubs
- WoD Bodyguards' reputations can be watched instead of zone reputations
- Cataclysm and retail support equipped capital city tabards while in dungeons
- Option to stop watching capital city tabard factions at Exalted
- Toggle on/off switching watched factions while you are taking taxi flights
- If you haven't discovered a zone reputation or there isn't one, select a default fallback watched reputation

## Open the options

- `/rbz`

## Bug Reports

If you encountered an error, file a report [on GitHub](https://github.com/Myrroddin/repbyzone/issues) and I will be notified.

## Known Issues

- It is not possible to display zone or subzone data for reputations the character has not yet discovered. Once a character gains or loses any amount of reputation with that faction and moves around the zone, RBZ will update.
- Discovering the faction may require the character to explore other zones or even continents, then kill mobs or do quests for the faction.
